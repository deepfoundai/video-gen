# AGENT COORDINATION PLAN
## Routing-Manager Production Deployment

### Overview
AGENT-06 (Routing-Manager) is operational in **dev** and ready for production promotion. This coordination plan distributes tasks across specialized agents to ensure smooth deployment and long-term stability.

### Agent Assignments

| Agent | Tasks | Dependencies | Timeline |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **DevOps-Automation** | Production deployment, SSM configuration, infrastructure | None | Immediate (30-45 min) |
| **Frontend-Integration** | Complete frontend build: Auth, API integration, pages, testing | Backend APIs deployed | 2-3 hours |
| **Monitoring-Agent** | Metrics setup, alerting configuration | DevOps completion | After prod deploy (30-45 min) |
| **Product-Planning** | Next increment roadmap, feature prioritization | Frontend & backend success | Post-integration |

### Critical Path
1. **DevOps-Automation** (Deploy backend infrastructure first)
2. **Frontend-Integration** (Complete frontend build with backend APIs)
3. **Monitoring-Agent** (After both frontend and backend are integrated)
4. **Product-Planning** (Continuous after successful integration)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Routing-Manager deployed to prod
- [ ] Complete frontend integration with auth, credits, job submission
- [ ] End-to-end video creation flow working
- [ ] Monitoring & alerting active
- [ ] Next increment roadmap defined

### Coordination Notes
- All agents should report status to this coordination plan
- Any blockers should be escalated immediately
- Smoke tests required before declaring success
