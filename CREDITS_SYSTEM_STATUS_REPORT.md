# Credits System Status Report

## Current State

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Credits Management Admin Page**
   - URL: https://admin.deepfoundai.com/raw-admin.html
   - Features:
     - User credits lookup by User ID
     - Update user credits
     - Credits change log (stored in browser localStorage)
     - Shows timestamp, old/new values, and admin who made changes
   - Test credentials: admin.test@deepfoundai.com / AdminTest123!

2. **Credits API Endpoints**
   - Base URL: https://dbmr3la6d3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   - All endpoints require JWT Bearer token authentication
   - Endpoints:
     - GET /credits/balance - Get user's credit balance
     - POST /credits/consume - Deduct credits (atomic operation)
     - GET /credits/admin?userId=xxx - Admin: get any user's credits
     - PUT /credits/admin - Admin: set user credits

3. **User Frontend Integration**
   - URL: https://video.deepfoundai.com
   - Shows credit balance in header
   - Prevents video generation if insufficient credits
   - Deducts 1 credit per video generation
   - Updates balance in real-time

4. **DynamoDB Backend**
   - Table: Credits-prod
   - Your account (todd.deshane@gmail.com) has 10 credits

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Authentication**
   - Admin page uses test credentials (admin.test@deepfoundai.com)
   - May need to update to use your actual admin account
   - Admin API access restricted to hardcoded user IDs in Lambda

2. **Credits Change Log**
   - Currently stored only in browser localStorage
   - Not persisted server-side
   - Lost if browser data is cleared
   - Not shared between admin users

### üßπ The Mess That Needs Cleanup

1. **My Mistakes During Implementation**
   - Initially added admin tab to user frontend (now removed)
   - Created multiple test files that should be cleaned up
   - Confusion about which admin page to update

2. **Files to Clean Up**
   - `/Users/tdeshane/video-app/admin-raw.html` - Duplicate admin file
   - Various test files in vanilla-frontend directory
   - Old Playwright test files that didn't work

3. **Architecture Issues**
   - Multiple admin pages/locations causing confusion
   - Credits log should be stored server-side
   - Admin authentication could be improved

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Test the admin credits management at https://admin.deepfoundai.com/raw-admin.html
   - Verify you can look up and modify user credits
   - Check that the credits change log is working

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Store credits change log in DynamoDB for persistence
   - Add role-based access control for admin features
   - Create CloudWatch alarms for unusual credit changes
   - Add credit purchase/payment integration

3. **Cleanup Tasks**
   ```bash
   # Remove duplicate admin file
   rm /Users/tdeshane/video-app/admin-raw.html
   
   # Clean up old test files
   rm /Users/tdeshane/video-app/vanilla-frontend/tests/credits-smoke-test.spec.js
   rm /Users/tdeshane/video-app/vanilla-frontend/tests/credits-smoke-test-minimal.spec.js
   rm /Users/tdeshane/video-app/vanilla-frontend/tests/CREDITS_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md
   ```

## Testing

Playwright tests confirm:
- ‚úÖ Admin page loads with credits management section
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints exist and return 401 for unauthorized requests
- ‚úÖ User frontend loads correctly

To manually test credits flow:
1. Login to admin page
2. Look up user ID: f4c8e4a8-3081-70cd-43f9-ea8a7b407430
3. Should show 10 credits
4. Change credits and observe log entry
5. Login to user site and verify balance shows correctly
