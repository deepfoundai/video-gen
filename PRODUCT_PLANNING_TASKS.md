# PRODUCT PLANNING TASKS
## Agent: Product-Planning
## Priority: CONTINUOUS
## Dependency: Current deployment success validation

### Objective
Define and prioritize the next increment of features for the video platform, focusing on expanding routing capabilities and user experience improvements.

### Task List

#### 1. Next Increment (P1) - Technical Expansion
**Priority Features:**

| Feature | Rationale | User Impact | Technical Complexity |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **ReplicateInvoker Queue** | Enable â‰¥10s / 1080p jobs | High - unlocks premium features | Medium |
| **Config-Driven Rules (SSM)** | Product team route control without deploys | Medium - faster iteration | Low |
| **A/B Weight (%) Routing** | Load balancing between Fal models | Low - optimization | High |

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Define ReplicateInvoker technical requirements
- [ ] Specify SSM configuration schema
- [ ] Design A/B testing framework
- [ ] Create user stories for each feature

#### 2. User Experience Roadmap
**Enhancement Areas:**

```
Phase 1 (Immediate): Basic Auto-Routing
- âœ… Provider auto-selection
- âœ… Fail-soft messaging
- ðŸ”„ User feedback collection

Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks): Extended Capabilities  
- ReplicateInvoker integration
- 1080p support
- 10+ second videos
- Advanced routing feedback

Phase 3 (1 month): Intelligent Routing
- User preference learning
- Quality-based routing
- Cost optimization routing
- Performance analytics
```

#### 3. Feature Prioritization Framework
**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criteria | Weight | ReplicateInvoker | Config Rules | A/B Routing |
|----------|--------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| User Demand | 40% | 9/10 | 6/10 | 4/10 |
| Technical Feasibility | 30% | 7/10 | 9/10 | 5/10 |
| Business Impact | 20% | 8/10 | 7/10 | 6/10 |
| Resource Requirements | 10% | 6/10 | 8/10 | 4/10 |
| **Total Score** | | **7.6** | **7.2** | **4.8** |

**Recommendation:** ReplicateInvoker â†’ Config Rules â†’ A/B Routing

#### 4. Market & Competitive Analysis
**Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Analyze competitor video processing capabilities
- [ ] Survey user demand for longer videos
- [ ] Research 1080p vs 4K adoption rates
- [ ] Evaluate pricing strategies for premium features

**Key Questions:**
- What video lengths do competitors support?
- How do users currently work around our 10s limit?
- What premium features would users pay for?
- How does routing transparency affect user trust?

#### 5. Success Metrics Definition
**KPIs for Next Increment:**

```yaml
metrics:
  technical:
    - routing_success_rate: >95%
    - avg_routing_latency: <200ms
    - supported_job_types: +50%
    
  business:
    - user_satisfaction: >4.2/5
    - premium_feature_adoption: >25%
    - support_ticket_reduction: -30%
    
  operational:
    - deployment_frequency: 2x/week
    - incident_resolution_time: <30min
    - configuration_changes_without_deploy: >80%
```

#### 6. Resource Planning
**Team Requirements:**

| Role | ReplicateInvoker | Config Rules | A/B Routing |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Backend Developer | 2 weeks | 1 week | 3 weeks |
| Frontend Developer | 1 week | 0.5 weeks | 2 weeks |
| DevOps Engineer | 1 week | 0.5 weeks | 1 week |
| QA Engineer | 1 week | 0.5 weeks | 2 weeks |

**Timeline Estimate:**
- ReplicateInvoker: 3 weeks
- Config Rules: 1.5 weeks  
- A/B Routing: 4 weeks

#### 7. Risk Assessment
**Potential Risks:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| ReplicateAPI rate limits | Medium | High | Implement smart throttling |
| User confusion with routing | Low | Medium | Clear UI messaging |
| Increased infrastructure costs | High | Medium | Usage-based pricing model |
| Config rule conflicts | Medium | Low | Validation framework |

#### 8. Stakeholder Communication Plan
**Updates Required:**
- [ ] Weekly progress reports to leadership
- [ ] User feedback collection and analysis
- [ ] Technical team coordination meetings
- [ ] Customer success team briefings

### Decision Points
**Go/No-Go Criteria for Next Features:**
1. Current deployment stable for 1 week
2. User feedback score >4.0/5 for auto-routing
3. Zero critical incidents in production
4. Resource availability confirmed

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Next increment roadmap approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed
- [ ] Success metrics baseline established
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans in place
- [ ] User research insights documented

### Continuous Monitoring
- Track current deployment success metrics
- Collect user feedback on auto-routing experience
- Monitor competitive landscape changes
- Adjust priorities based on learnings
