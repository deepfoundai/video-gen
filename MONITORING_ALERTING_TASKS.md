# MONITORING & ALERTING TASKS
## Agent: Monitoring-Agent
## Priority: POST-DEPLOYMENT
## Dependency: DevOps deployment must be complete and healthy

### Objective
Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for Routing-Manager production operations.

### Task List

#### 1. Core Metrics Setup
**Metrics to Track:**

| Metric Name | Description | Threshold |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `RoutingManager/Routed` | Successfully routed jobs | <10 jobs/hour (warning) |
| `RoutingManager/Rejected` | Jobs rejected by router | >20% of submissions (alert) |
| `RoutingManager/DLQDepth` | Dead letter queue depth | ≥1 message (immediate alert) |
| `RoutingManager/Latency` | Routing decision time | >500ms (warning) |
| `RoutingManager/Errors` | System errors | Any error (alert) |

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch custom metrics
- [ ] Set up metric filters for log groups
- [ ] Create CloudWatch dashboard
- [ ] Test metric collection with sample jobs

#### 2. Alerting Configuration
**Alert Definitions:**

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Routing DLQ Alert"
    metric: "RoutingManager/DLQDepth"
    threshold: "≥1"
    action: "SNS notification"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    
  - name: "Low Routing Volume"
    metric: "RoutingManager/Routed"
    threshold: "<10 jobs in 1 hour"
    action: "SNS notification"
    severity: "WARNING"
    
  - name: "High Rejection Rate"
    metric: "RoutingManager/Rejected"
    threshold: ">20% of submissions"
    action: "SNS notification + Slack"
    severity: "HIGH"
```

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Create SNS topics for different severity levels
- [ ] Configure CloudWatch alarms
- [ ] Set up Slack integration (if available)
- [ ] Test alert firing and notifications

#### 3. Operational Dashboards
**Dashboard Components:**
- Real-time routing statistics
- Queue depth monitoring
- Error rate trends
- Performance metrics
- Health status indicators

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Create main operational dashboard
- [ ] Add routing decision breakdown charts
- [ ] Include queue health metrics
- [ ] Set up automated dashboard sharing

#### 4. Log Analytics
**Log Monitoring:**
- Structured logging for routing decisions
- Error pattern detection
- Performance analysis
- Audit trail for routing rules

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Configure log insights queries
- [ ] Set up log-based metrics
- [ ] Create log analysis dashboard
- [ ] Implement log retention policies

### DevOps-Automation Integration
**Request to DevOps-Automation Agent:**
```
devops.request: deployAlarm
parameters:
  - service: RoutingManager
  - environment: prod
  - alertConfigs: [see alert definitions above]
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All metrics collecting data within 15 minutes
- [ ] Alerts properly configured and tested
- [ ] Dashboard accessible to operations team
- [ ] Log analysis queries working
- [ ] No false positive alerts in first hour

### Monitoring Validation
**Test Plan:**
1. Submit test jobs to trigger routing
2. Verify metrics appear in CloudWatch
3. Trigger test alert by simulating failure
4. Confirm notifications sent properly
5. Validate dashboard displays correctly

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Weekly review of alert thresholds
- Monthly dashboard optimization
- Quarterly metric review and cleanup
- Document all monitoring procedures

### Escalation Procedures
**If monitoring setup fails:**
1. Document failure details
2. Notify coordination team
3. Implement basic monitoring as fallback
4. Schedule retry with lessons learned

**If alerts fire after setup:**
1. Investigate root cause immediately
2. Update coordination team
3. Adjust thresholds if needed
4. Document incident and resolution
