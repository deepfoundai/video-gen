## Work Specification

### Overview
The Admin dashboard overview Lambda is returning 502 errors instead of proper JSON responses. Need to identify and fix the root cause to restore admin functionality.

### Problem Statement
- Admin dashboard shows "Failed to fetch" errors
- Lambda function returning 502 instead of 2xx with JSON
- Likely issues: IAM role permissions, environment variables, or response format

### Investigation Steps

#### 1. CloudWatch Logs Analysis
- Review recent error logs from Admin overview Lambda
- Identify specific error patterns and stack traces
- Check for timeout issues or runtime errors
- Look for missing environment variables or configuration

#### 2. IAM Role Verification
- Verify Lambda execution role has required permissions
- Check for missing DynamoDB, S3, or other service permissions
- Validate resource-based policies if applicable
- Compare with working Lambda roles in the system

#### 3. Environment Variables
- Verify all required environment variables are set
- Check stage-specific configuration (prod vs dev)
- Validate connection strings and endpoints
- Ensure no missing or malformed configuration

#### 4. Response Format
- Ensure Lambda returns proper API Gateway response format
- Verify CORS headers are included
- Check Content-Type headers
- Validate JSON structure and encoding

### Resolution Requirements

#### 1. Root Cause Identification
- Document specific cause of 502 errors
- Provide CloudWatch logs showing the error
- Explain why the issue occurred

#### 2. Fix Implementation
- Apply appropriate fix (IAM, environment, code, etc.)
- Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
- Test both prod and dev environments
- Verify CORS headers are properly configured

#### 3. Validation
- Admin dashboard loads without errors
- Overview data displays correctly
- No 502 errors in CloudWatch logs
- Response times under 3 seconds

#### 4. Prevention
- Add CloudWatch alarms for 502 errors
- Include proper error handling in Lambda
- Document configuration requirements
- Add health check endpoint if missing

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 502 errors eliminated from Admin overview Lambda
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads and displays data correctly
- [ ] CloudWatch logs show successful 2xx responses
- [ ] CORS headers properly configured
- [ ] Error handling improved to prevent future 502s
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms configured for monitoring
- [ ] Root cause documented in commit message
- [ ] Fix verified in both prod and dev environments
